        Choose your favorite **racetrack** and your **laptimes** will be automatically 
        recorded by triggering the timer when the start and finish lines are crossed. 
        
        This was my first iPhone application. It was great fun to develop it and it taught me a lot. 
        For casually timing yourself on a racetrack, it gets the job done very well.
