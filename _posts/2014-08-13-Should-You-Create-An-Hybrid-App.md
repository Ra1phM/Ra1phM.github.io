When I first heard about hybrid mobile applications I was both excited and cautious. Actually, as a native developer I was very cautious. Some aspects like JavaScript accessing native functions and overall speed was a major concern. I forgot about this technology only until I was working on a new mobile application which seemed to be a good candidate. 

## HTML, CSS and Javascript In Wonderland

You can develop **native looking mobile application** with web technologies! And most of all, you **write code** once and you have an iOS, Android, Windows and BlackBerry application ready to deploy! There exist numerous frameworks which closely match the native look of each device ([Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) or [Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) to just name a two).

## The Ugly Part

From a performance point of view, many people, including me, tend to believe that hybrid applications are **slow**. It’s **wrong**, but, you need to keep in mind that you are on a device and not a desktop browser and that your code still needs to be **optimized** in some way. My feeling about speed is that iOS will probably be very fine and you won’t see much performance issues even with some poor code snippets. 

Android has [78% market share](http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-v-android-market-share-2014-5), but those are **NOT all top high-end Android phones**! Some are slower, some are faster. Some have big screens, some have very small screens. With that being said, your app needs to be even **more responsive**. Yes, you only write code once, but your code needs to be able to **adapt to a wide range** of different devices.

## Fast Changes

With **iOS 8** coming out very soon, with over [4000 new APIs and Apple’s new language Swift](https://developer.apple.com/ios8/), Also **Android L** with the new material design, lots of smart watches, car and TV stuff you might prefer to go native to embrace the **full potential** of what the device has to offer. If your goal is to build a business or build an app for your existing business, then why not focus on one operating system, incrementally improve it and later expand to support more platforms? Doing too much and trying to support everything from day 1 might not result in the best expected outcome.

## To Hybrid or Not To Hybrid

At the end it all comes down to your requirements, available resources and skills. Personally, I will choose native 99.9% of the time, unless the app I’m developing looks and behaves more like a mini website and doesn’t use too many fancy device features. Hybrid apps are somehow great as a short term solution, but in the long run you are much better off writing native code.
