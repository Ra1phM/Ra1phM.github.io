Your time is **precious**! It runs no matter what happens and once gone, it’s gone. No known or proven device can give it back to you. What could you do instead of feeling sorry for yourself and wishing you would have better spent your time in the past? Better managing your time in the future seems to be the only solution, but how? 

You could buy a book about time management. It will for sure contain lots of valuable information on how to better spent your time on a daily basis. But, this is not really what you want, is it? You don’t want to spent time on learning how to save time. Additionally, it takes some time to fully adopt your new time management strategy and you might not see the results directly. However, there exists another way that might be easier and faster but might not be free. Now, this is where **businesses can shine**.

Ideally, your product solves a problem in an easy and simple way. If you introduce more complexity and add more steps to achieve the same result by using with another tool, then why should a person use your solution? Right there is a **key** to design a successful app. Reduce as much as possible the number of steps to achieve a goal. In the case of a mobile application, typically, you want to minimize the number of taps and text inputs required to fully enjoy the application. Avoid those never-ending sign-up forms. For example, is the second password field, which validates your first password entry, really needed? Might it not be a more enjoyable user experience to only ask for the password once? Don’t take your users for complete fools. In case they mistyped their password, they can just ask to reset it. 

To conclude, your users should be able to achieve what they want with **minimum effort**. If your app saves them time and they realize that, then they will see some **value** using your app. The more it is clear to your users what they gains are, the more valuable your app will be to them. Thus, the easier it might be to convert them into paying customers.
