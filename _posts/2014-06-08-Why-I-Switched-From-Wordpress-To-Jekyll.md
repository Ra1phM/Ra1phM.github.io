When the time comes for you to build a blog, you will be faced with this fundamental question: **How do I build it?** Nowadays there are a lot of solutions to create an online blog. Choosing the right one for you might be more difficult as you think it is. I will explain why I decided to dump my [WordPress][1] powered website and replace it with a static website, generated with [Jekyll][2] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][3] for **free** (Yes, for free!).

## What I need

As many others, I want to be out there on the web and have a nice digital footprint. I like to write about topics I’m interested in and working on. So for me, a personal blog is a quite perfect to express. A blog is also a great way to complement your presence on social media.

##The Obvious Choice

The most obvious choice is WordPress. It’s a great platform, the community is large and active, there are a tremendous amount of plugins and themes and most hosting services supports it perfectly out of the box. How can you possibly go wrong with WordPress? It can do everything you need for your website.

## What’s wrong with WordPress?

Well, the issue is just there! WordPress (or any other 
CMS) can do everything. It’s packed with tons of features and complexity you don’t need. It’s like using a computer when you just need a small calculator. The computer can do a lot, but in reality you just want to do some basic operations on numbers. So, why would you use a full-blown CMS when there are other attractive and (in my opinion) more fun solutions?

## Jekyll, the Static Website Generator

You might have heard of [Jekyll][2]. It generates a static website written with [Markdown][4] and [Liquid][5], HTML and CSS. The generated output is **ready to be deployed**! There is no need to setup a database, moderate the website using a fancy administration panel or updating the main framework or any other plugin every two days. Most of all, Jekyll is **blog-aware**, which means that you have permalinks, categories, tags, pages, posts and custom layouts. Just like your WordPress with just enough dynamic behavior to be comfortable with.

Oh, did I mentioned that you can host your website for free on [GitHub Pages][3]? I don’t work for GitHub, but they are providing a really great service. To make an update, just make changes to your local Jekyll project, push it to your repository and your website is up to date. It’s fast, simple and you can setup your own domain or sub-domain. There is a good [documentation][3] which explains it all. However, you might need `coding` skills (mainly HTML, CSS and some Liquid) to fully enjoy the Jekyll experience, because it is about building your website yourself and having full control over it without the hassle and complexity of a CMS.

At the end of the day, it is a preference choice. If you are happy with your CMS, it’s perfectly fine. After all, some features can make your life easier if you truly need the power of a CMS to build a complex website. But, if you are like me, tired of big and heavy frameworks to solve small problems, then I encourage you to try out Jekyll. You might get amazed of how **simple** it is to manage your website and even how much **fun** it is to write a post using [Markdown][4].
